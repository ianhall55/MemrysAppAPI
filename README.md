memrys App

memrys is a photo sharing app that will allows you to conveniently share photos.
The inspiration for this app came to me at a family wedding. My family got
together for pictures and we had to wait to take the same photos with
10 different people's smartphones.  With memrys you can collaborate with other
people in shared event folders where you can add your own photos and download any
photos that other people have added that you want to store locally.  These event
folders are only accessible by members of the group so if you have an event,
such as a bachelor party, where you don't want the whole world to see the photos,
you'll have your privacy.

memrys is built using React Native.  The app's state is managed by Redux for
unidirectional, frontend data flow.  The app utilizes a Rails API backend
that is accessed through fetch requests.  

memrys keeps track of your user account and stores your personal information securly
